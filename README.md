Contents of the book '처음 만나는 AI 수학 with 파이썬'. 
This was the most interesting book ever since studying coding.
There are some noteworthy parts worth mentioning:
- All mathematical explanation of concepts used in AI programming, especially Sum of Squares for Error, entropy theories, forwards propagation, back propagation
- Demonstration of a single neuron learning and fitting to the given data
- introductory part of linear algebra -> going through the book prompted me to realize the importance of studying linear algebra
